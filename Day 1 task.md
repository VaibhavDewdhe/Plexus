# Internship Task Document
## Title: Project Research and Planning Task

### Objective
Each student has to choose one project idea and write a simple plan for it.  
The goal of this task is to understand how well you can think, plan, and explain your idea clearly.  
You do not need to do any coding for this task. Just research and make a clear written plan.

## What You Have To Do

1. **Choose a Project**
   - Pick one project from the list of 50 project ideas given to you.
   - Or you can choose your own project idea if you have something different in mind.
   - Your project must solve some real-world problem.

2. **Decide the Technology**
   - You can use **Java Stack** (Spring Boot + MySQL + React or JSP)  
     or **MERN Stack** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js).
   - You only need to write which stack you want to use and why.

3. **Follow Monolithic Architecture**
   - The whole project should be a single complete system (not microservices).
   - It should have three main parts: **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Database**.

## What To Include In Your Document

Write a short report with the following sections. You can make it in Word, Markdown, or Text file.

### 1. Project Overview
- Project Title  
- What problem does it solve?  
- Who will use it?  
- What will be the result or benefit?  

### 2. Research
- Is there already something similar? (Write 2–3 lines)  
- How will your project be better or different?  
- Why did you choose Java Stack or MERN Stack?  

### 3. System Plan (Simple)
- Write what your project will have in the **frontend** (for example: forms, pages, buttons).  
- Write what your project will have in the **backend** (for example: login system, APIs, logic).  
- Write what kind of data will be stored in the **database**.  
- You can draw a simple block diagram if you want.  

### 4. Features List
Write 5 to 7 main features your project will have. For example:  
- User login and signup  
- Data dashboard  
- Search option  
- Report generation  

### 5. Expected Output
Write what the user will get when using your system. (Example: A report, a result page, a chart, etc.)

### 6. Tools You Will Use
List all tools or platforms you plan to use (for example: VS Code, XAMPP, MongoDB, etc.)

## Submission Details
- File name: `<YourName>_<ProjectTitle>_Plan`  
- Format: `.docx`, `.txt`, or `.md`  
- Submit it before the end of the day (by 11:59 PM).  
- You can handwrite it if you don’t know how to make a file, but it must be neat and clear.

## Rules
- Do not copy someone else’s idea or content.  
- You can take help from the internet or AI tools, but the idea and writing must be your own.  
- Keep it short, simple, and clear.  
- Focus more on the idea, not on design or code.

## Purpose
This task is given to see how you think, plan, and present your ideas clearly.  
You will not be judged on technical knowledge — only on your clarity, creativity, and problem-solving approach.
